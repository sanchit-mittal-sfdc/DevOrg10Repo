Differences and Best Practices
1. Public Variables
Simple Declaration: Declaring a public variable directly is straightforward.
Direct Access: The variable is directly accessible and modifiable.
2. Properties with Getter and Setter Methods
Encapsulation: Using getter and setter methods provides better encapsulation and control over how the property is accessed and modified.
Future Flexibility: If you later need to add logic to the getter or setter (e.g., validation, transformation), you can do so without changing the external interface of the class.
Best Practice: Use Getter and Setter Methods
Using getter and setter methods is generally considered best practice because it provides better encapsulation and future flexibility. Here’s an example:
apex
Copy code
public with sharing class SfdcOrgsResponseWrapper {
    @AuraEnabled
    public String orgName { get; set; }
}

Example Class with Multiple Properties
Apex Properties
An Apex property is similar to a variable; however, you can do additional things in your code to a property value before it’s accessed or returned. Properties can be used to validate data before a change is made, to prompt an action when data is changed (such as altering the value of other member variables), or to expose data that is retrieved from some other source (such as another class).
Property definitions include one or two code blocks, representing a get accessor and a set accessor:
The code in a get accessor executes when the property is read.
The code in a set accessor executes when the property is assigned a new value.
If a property has only a get accessor, it’s considered read-only. If a property has only a set accessor, it’s considered write-only. A property with both accessors is considered read-write.


To declare a property, use the following syntax in the body of a class:
Public class BasicClass {


   // Property declaration
   access_modifier return_type property_name {
      get {
         //Get accessor code block
      }
      set {
         //Set accessor code block
      }
   } 
}


Where:
access_modifier is the access modifier for the property. The access modifiers that can be applied to properties include: public, private, global, and protected. In addition, these definition modifiers can be applied: static and transient. For more information on access modifiers, see Access Modifiers.
return_type is the type of the property, such as Integer, Double, sObject, and so on. For more information, see Data Types.
property_name is the name of the property
For example, the following class defines a property named prop. The property is public. The property returns an integer data type.


public class BasicProperty {
   public integer prop {
      get { return prop; }
      set { prop = value; }
   }
}
